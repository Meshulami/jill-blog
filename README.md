Hi, My name's Jill. I'm an algorithms' engineer, and I work mainly in the field of satellite collection resources optimization.

A short time ago, I started dealing in the subject of dividing satellite collection orders between constellations. This is an important project for me because I joined it (almost) from the beginning - at least the part where we started conceptualizing the solution that will solve this problem.

For me, the fact that I get to be the one writing the first lines of code of this system is a privilege and an exciting venture. Therefore, I decided to write a blog about the issues we came and will come across, and how I personally try and deal with this large, somewhat undefined problem.

Hope you enjoy reading, and feel free to ask questions!
